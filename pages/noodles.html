    <h2>Once you have your ingredients, it's time to begin preparing the meal</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin, gather all of your ingredients together and set them out. Having an organized space is an essential when it comes to cooking</li>
        <li>Begin by placeing your ground beef in a skillet and cooking until brown.  You will want to add salt, pepper, and a generous amount of italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>In a seperate skillet, go ahead and begin browning your italian suasage.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is fully cooked, set aside for later.</li>
        <p><em><strong>If you are trying to make the dish healthier, feel free to drain the grease.</strong>  If health isn't your goal, then keep that grease for flavor!</em></p>
        <li>Now it's time to prepare the noodles. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. <strong>Be sure to salt the water</strong></li>
        <li>Place the pasta sheets in the pot, until they become soft and begin to float to the top. Remove from water and allow them to cool.</li>
        <li>Now here comes the fun part.  We will line the baking dish with a singular layer of the pasta sheets. On top of the sheet, we will add a layer of meat, ricotta cheese, your other cheeses, and sauce. Repeat this 4 times.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
